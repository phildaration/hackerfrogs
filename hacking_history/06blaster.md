# Hacking History - Target 06: Blaster Worm
## Research Date: 2024-07-17
## What happened?
A computer worm (self-replicating virus) was released in August 2003, affecting computers using Windows XP and Windows 2000. 
## When was the hack discovered?
August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003. (W)
## How long do we think the hackers were operating before the hack was discovered?
August 11, 2003, within hours of being released.
## Who was the target of the hack?
There was no specific targets in the attack. It was meant to spread indiscriminately.
## How was the target initially compromised? What other hacking methods were employed?
The worm takes advantage of a buffer overflow attack in the DCOM RPC service. The vulnerability was patched a few months before this worm was deployed.
## What was the impact of the hack?
At its peak, it's reported that 423,000 of systems were infected.
## Was the hacker identified? How confident are we of attribution?
Jeffrey Lee Parson, an 18-year-old from Hopkins, Minnesota, was indicted for creating the B variant of the Blaster worm.
## Was the hacker punished? If so, how?
Jeffrey Lee Parson was sentenced to an 18-month prison term in January 2005
## What is this hacker doing now? Did they engage in other known hacks?
We do not know.
## What was the response to the hack?
MS released a security patch and removal tool for this worm. Antivirus companies created signatures for the virus to flag it on infected systems if they ran AV.
## What makes this hack famous?
* widespread impact (423000 computers affected)
* exploit of known vulnerability (patch was available already when this worm started spreading)
* political motive (a message was sent to bill gates in the execution of the virus)
* helpful worm (Welchia) was created to help users remove the virus and patch their systems
## Lessons Learned?
* patch management (patch your systems and update your Windows in a timely manner)
* public awareness campaigns (let the public know that there's a big bad virus out there, and they should be updating their Windows OS)
