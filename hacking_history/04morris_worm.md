# Target 04: Morris Worm
## Research date: 2024-07-10
## What happened?
Morris wrote and distributed a computer virus from the MIT campus which then infected most of the computers on the internet at the time (6000 systems), and rendered a lot of systems inoperable.
## When was the hack discovered?
The hack was discovered within hours of initial infection on the network (by the next morning)
## How long do we think the hackers were operating before the hack was discovered?
Not long (hours)
## Who was the target of the hack?
Initially, the MIT computer network.
## How was the target initially compromised? What other hacking methods were employed?
- Remote login (rlogin): The worm would try to guess passwords to gain access to remote systems.
- Finger service: This service provided information about users and was exploited to execute code remotely.
- Sendmail: A mail transfer agent, exploited to execute code remotely.
## What was the impact of the hack?
Most of the internet was taken offline.
## Was the hacker identified? How confident are we of attribution?
Boy was he ever. We are very confident of attribution, because he admitted to it.
## Was the hacker punished? If so, how?
After appeals, he was sentenced to three years' probation, 400 hours of community service, and a fine of US$10,050 (equivalent to $22,000 in 2023) plus the costs of his supervision. (W)
## What is this hacker doing now? Did they engage in other known hacks?
He earned a PhD from Harvard University and worked at various technology companies, including Google and Cloudera. He also became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he taught computer science and cybersecurity.
## What was the response to the hack?
Increased Awareness: It highlighted the vulnerability of interconnected systems and the potential for widespread damage from malicious code. This raised public awareness about cybersecurity threats and the need for better protection.
Development of Security Tools: The incident spurred the development of new security tools and technologies, including antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and firewalls, to detect and prevent similar attacks.
Improved Security Practices: Organizations began implementing better security practices, such as stronger passwords, regular security audits, and incident response plans, to mitigate risks. (Gemini)
## What makes this hack famous?
- the first worm virus
- the first hacker conviction
- the first time the internet was taken offline
## Lessons Learned?
- Unintended consequences of code
- The critical importance of cybersecurity
- Unintended consequences are real
