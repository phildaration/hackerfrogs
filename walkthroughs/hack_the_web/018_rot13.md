# Concept
* the ROT13 cipher is a encryption method where you shift all letters of the plaintext message by 13 letter positions to form the ciphertext
* to decrypt the message, we do the exact same operation, shifting all letters by 13 positions in the alphabet
# Method of solve
* copy all the text in the ciphertext message and use a webapp like rot13.com to decrypt the message
* alternatively you can use the slider provided on the challenge page, and put in the middle of the slider bar
* the answer is `speigelbild`
