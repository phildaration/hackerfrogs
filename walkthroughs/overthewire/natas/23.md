There are two requirements for the password that needs to be submitted to receive the credentials for the next level
```
<?php
    if(array_key_exists("passwd",$_REQUEST)){
        if(strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 )){
            echo "<br>The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
            echo "<pre>Username: natas24 Password: <censored></pre>";
        }
        else{
            echo "<br>Wrong!<br>";
        }
    }
    // morla / 10111
?>  
```
This code requires that the password contain the string `iloveyou` in it, and it also requires that the password be larger than the integer 10. We need to abuse the way PHP treats strings, and prefix the `iloveyou` string with a number that is greater than the number 10, since the greater-than comparison operator will convert strings to numbers before comparison, so we can use the string `11iloveyou` to fulfill both requirements for the password. The strstr function ensures that the indicated string is included in the password, so `11iloveyou` qualifies.
