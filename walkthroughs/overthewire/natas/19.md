It looks like this app is still using the same method of assigning session IDs to be used as cookies, but a dash and the name of the user is appended, so a random "admin" login might look like:
```
101-admin
```
The cookie is then encoded from ASCII to hexadecimal, so the resulting cookie is a hex string. So what we need to do I run the same script as the last level, but after generating the number in the range, prepend it to "-admin" and then convert it to hexadecimal before sending each request.
