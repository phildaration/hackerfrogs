# objective
This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism. A certain feature invokes a dangerous method on data provided in a serialized object. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie and use it to delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
You also have access to a backup account: `gregg:rosebud` 
# method of solve
1) Use the Burp browser to login to the app using the provided credentials `wiener:peter`
2) Change the user's avatar by uploading any image file
3) Go to Burp Suite and send the POST request for changing the avatar to the Burp Repeater
4) In the repeater, highlight the cookie, and notice that the file path for the avatar is included in the cookie
5) Adjust the cookie in the Inspector so that the avatar file path is `/home/carlos/morale.txt` and the string length is `23`, then select `Apply`
6) Send the POST request off
7) Go back to the Burp browser and delete the account
