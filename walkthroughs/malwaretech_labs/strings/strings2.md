* Inspect the decompiler, and note that the Md5 function references the local_30 memory address, and we see it contains a single character, `F`. We also see that there's a string of single characters defined in many many memory locations, which we can collect and convert from hex to ASCII, which gives the flag
* Grab the output from the Ghidra decompiler window, and paste it into a file, then:
```
cat temp.txt | cut -d '=' -f 2 | tr -d ';' | tr -d '\n' | xxd -r -p
```
