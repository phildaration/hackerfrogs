# key points
* one important concept in this level is that if our character is `defeat`, then we are destroyed
* that means we have to avoid forming the rule `baba is defeat`
# method of solve
1) form the rule `flag is open`
2) push the flag into the door, giving us access to the crab text
3) form the rule `baba is baba` to prevent transformation
4) push the crab text up to form `crab is win`
