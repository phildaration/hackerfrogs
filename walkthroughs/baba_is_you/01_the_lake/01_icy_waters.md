# key points
We are introduced to the "AND" text, which lets two rules be connected and activated at once, by creating this type of rule "object is verb and verb" or "object1 and object2 is verb"
# method of solve
Break the rule "baba is you and sink" so that sink is no longer activated, then move the "baba is you" rule out tile by tile, and form the rule "wall and baba is you"
. After that, move the walls and baba to the right, so that the jellys are sunk, and we move into the flag, which lets us win.
