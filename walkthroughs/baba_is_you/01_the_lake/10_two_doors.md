# key points
* if there's a object against a wall, and we have access to two object texts and two `is` texts, then we can slide the `you` text towards the object against the wall and eventually form a `object is you` with the object against the wall
# method of solve
1) Set the rule `door is you`
2) Setup the `you` slide with the `keke` and `door` objects
3) Setup the rule `key is you`, then setup the rule `flag is win`
4) Touch the flag to win
