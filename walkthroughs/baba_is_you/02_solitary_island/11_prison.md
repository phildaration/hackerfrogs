# key points
* there's a technique used in this level that can be used to break up rules that normally cannot be broken due to being pushed up against a wall
# method of solve
1) form the rules `baba is you` and `keke is push`, sharing the same `is` tile
2) push `keke` to the tile directly on above the `wall text`
3) break the rule `keke is push`
4) move the `wall is stop` rule up a tile, so that the `wall text` overlaps with `keke`
5) form the rule `keke is you`
6) move down, breaking the rule `wall is stop`
7) form the rule `keke is win`
