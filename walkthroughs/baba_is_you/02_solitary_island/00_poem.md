* this level also introduces two new objects, `rose` and `violet`
# method of solve
1) move the lines of `is` text two tiles down
2) move the `violet text` to the left
3) move the `rose text` out, into position below the `baba text`
4) move the object row up, forming `baba is win` and `rose is you`
