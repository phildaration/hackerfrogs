# key points
* we can use `move`ing objects to push rules into place in areas of the map where we don't have access
# method of solve
1) form the rule `cog is robot` to create an extra robot
2) push the `and` and `is` into position directly to the left of the `bog` so that it will form the rule `flag and rock is win` if pushed enough tiles to the right
3) move the robots directly to the left of the `and` and `is` text objects
4) form the rule `robot is move`
5) move on top of the flag
6) wait until the rule `flag and rock is win` is formed
