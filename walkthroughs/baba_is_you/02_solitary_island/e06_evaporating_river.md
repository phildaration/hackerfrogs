# key points
* we can overlap objects, then apply the `sink` rule to one of them to remove both objects
* forming the `object is sink` rule with text overlapping the object can let you destroy the object with one of the text tiles
# method of solve
1) break the rule `water is sink`
2) form the rule `water is sink` horizontally, such that the `water` text is overlapping a water tile when formed, destroying the `water` object and the `water` text
3) move the `cog` into position directly to the right of the `flag` text, overlapping the `skull`
4) form the rule `cog is sink`, destroying both the `cog` and the the `skull`
5) form the rule `flag is win`
6) touch the `flag` to win
