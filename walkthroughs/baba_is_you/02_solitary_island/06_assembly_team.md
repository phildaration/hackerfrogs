# key points
* we are introduced to two new objects: the `robot` and `pipe`
# method of solve
1) use the `baba text` to act as a buffer so we can break the line of movement for the two robots that we control
2) move one of the robots into the water, so we have access to the `is` and `you` text
3) form the rule `baba is you`
