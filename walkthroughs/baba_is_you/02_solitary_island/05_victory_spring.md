# key points
* text that is floating can't be used to clear `sink` tiles
# method of solve
1) push the cogs to the left-hand side of the `win` text, creating a C pattern with the `win` text in the left-hand side of the C
2) move the rule `text is float` to the right until the `float` text is over the water tile
3) break the `text is float` rule by moving the `is` text
4) form the rule `baba is win`
