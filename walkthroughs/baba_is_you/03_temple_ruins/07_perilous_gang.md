# key points
* use `move` objects to setup rules in other places
# method of solve
1) setup the `is` and `push` text tiles in positions below the `skull` text so that the rule `skull is push` will be setup once moved a sufficient number of positions to the right
2) set the rule `ghost is move`
3) wait and break the rule `ghost is move` the moment that `skull is push` is set
4) move the skulls out of the way and setup the rule `ghost is win`
5) touch the `ghost` to win
