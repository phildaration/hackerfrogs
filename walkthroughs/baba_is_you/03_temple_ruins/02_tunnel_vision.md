# key points
* this level introduces the `has` rule, which cases the latter object to spawn if the former object is desroyed, e.g., if `rock has key`, then a key will spawn if a rock is destroyed
* if an object `has` itself, then it is effectively indestructible
# method of solve
1) form the rule `rock has rock`, after `baba` is destroyed
2) push the `rock` through the `water`, then touch the `flag`
