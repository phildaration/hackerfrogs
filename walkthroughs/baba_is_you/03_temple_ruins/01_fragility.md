# key points
* this is the first level that features the `weak` rule, which causes a `weak` object to be destroyed if it comes into contact with another object in any way
* even if an object is `defeat`, the player can move into and destroy it if it is also `weak`
* `weak` objects can be `pushed`, but will be destroyed if they make contact with other objects
# method of solve
