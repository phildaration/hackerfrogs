# key points
* there are points in levels where you need to use a sled of move objects to break the `is you` rule and re-establish it somewhere else on the map
# method of solve
1) break the rule `baba is move`
2) form the rule `baba is push`
3) form the three `baba`s on the 3rd, 5th, and 6th rows (from the bottom) of the map, all facing left
4) move the `keke is you` rule down several tiles, so that the `you` tile is on the 3rd row of the map (from the bottom)
5) form the rule `keke is push` horizontally
6) form the rule `baba is move`, then stand `keke` on top of the `keke is you` rule
7) wait several turns, while the `baba`s move `keke`, the `keke text`, and the `you text` to the right-hand side of the map
8) when the rule `keke is you` is established on the right-hand side of the map, you should be standing on the `flag` and win
9) if you didn't win, then you didn't break the `baba is move` rule early enough
