# key points
* if we have two objects we can become, the `has` text, and the `move` text we can use one of those objects to move past any `defeat` objects
# method of solve
1) form the rule `keke is you`
2) form `baba is keke`
3) form `keke has baba`
4) move one of the `keke`s into the water, creating a `baba`
5) form `baba is move`, but break it after crossing the `water`
6) setup `is keke has`, then `baba is keke`
7) form `keke has baba`, then move `keke` into the door
8) form `baba is move`, then break it when `baba` passes over the `water`
9) form `baba is you`, then touch the `flag` to win
