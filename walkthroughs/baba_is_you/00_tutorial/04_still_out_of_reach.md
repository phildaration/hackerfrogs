# Key Points
We are introduced to the "defeat" rule. If we move into an object with the "defeat" rule enabled, we will be destroyed. But, other objects can move through "defeat" objects normally.
# Method of Solve
We need to use the rocks, which have the "push" rule applied, and form a line of rocks to move through the skull wall and break the "skull is defeat" rule, then touch flag to win.
