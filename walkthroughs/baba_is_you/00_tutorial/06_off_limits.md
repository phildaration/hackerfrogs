# Key Points
We have to keep in mind that we can change our playable character / object to something else, especially if that object is a part of the map that we cannot normally access.
# Method of Solve
Break the "wall is stop" rule, and then create the "wall is you" rule, which lets us win because there are parts of the wall on the other of the skulls, which we didn't have access to before.
