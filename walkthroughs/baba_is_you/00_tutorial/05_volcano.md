# Key Points
We are introduced to the "hot" and "melt" rules. This rule makes it so that if a "melt" object enters the same space as a "hot" object, then the melt object is destroyed. 
# Method of Solve
We have access to the lava text. And with that, we can form the rule "lava is push". This means we can push the lava out of the way, and get access to the flag.
