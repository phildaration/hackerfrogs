# Key Points
We're introduced to the sink "verb". Any object that moves into a tile with "sink" applied to it will be destroyed, along with the sink object itself.
# Method of Solve
First, we need to push a rock into the water that is preventing us from accessing the rest of the rooms. We don't have enough rocks to sink and get access to the flag, so we change the win condition to be the rock, making "rock is win"
