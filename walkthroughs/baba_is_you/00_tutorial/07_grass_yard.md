# Key Points
We should be on the lookout for explit rules, and keep in mind that even if our instincts tell us that a rule should be in place, it isn't always the case.
# Method of Solve
There is no rule "wall is stop", so we move all the other text objects out of the the grass area and form "flag is win" by creating the rule vertically.
