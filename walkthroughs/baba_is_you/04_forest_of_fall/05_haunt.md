# key points
* this level features the `wall rule breaking` technique, where if you sandwich a rule between two player objects, you can break the rule by sandwiching the rule between the player objects and mashing them against a barrier
* if you control more than 1 object at a time, you can form a `is you` sled to interact with text tiles pushed up against the wall
# method of solve
1) Form the rule `ghost is you`
2) move the `push` text against the lower-left wall do you can create a separation of 3 spaces between the `ghosts`
3) move the `ghost`s between the `leaf is defeat` rule
4) break up the `leaf is defeat` rule by moving right, then left
5) move the ghosts next to each other horizontally, then form the rule `baba is you` by pushing the `is you` text up into the `baba` text
6) as `baba`, push the `ghost` text down and form the rule `ghost is you`
7) as the `ghost`s form the `baba is you` rule
8) form the `leaf is you` rule
9) form the rule `love is win`, then touch the `love` to win
