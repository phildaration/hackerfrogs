# key points
* we use the `tele` rule to setup an `object is win` rule by subbing in the actual object instead of the object text, then changing the actual object into text with the `text` rule
# method of solve
1) push the `is` text into the tile above the `win` text
2) form the rule `text is you` by pushing the `text`
3) use the `box` to form the rule `keke is you` by moving into the box from below
4) slide the `keke is you` rule to the left until `keke` is in the same column as the `water` tile
5) setup the `is win` text by moving it directly below the `water` tile
6) form the rule `flag is you` from below
7) push the `box` text onto the water tile, then enter the `water` tile from above, forming the rule `keke is you`
8) form the rule `flag is text` when the `flag` is on the right-hand side of the map
9) form the rule `box is flag`
10) touch the `flag` to win
