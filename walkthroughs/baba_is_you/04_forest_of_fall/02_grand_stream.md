# key points
* this level introduces the `pull` rule, which allows objects to be pulled by moving objects
# method of solve
1) break the rule `key is pull`
2) set the rule `keke is pull`
3) pull `keke` into the same row as the `key`
4) set the rules `keke is move` and `key is pull`
5) after the `key` is pulled across the water by `keke`, break the rule `keke is move`
6) pull the `key` on top of the `box` to reveal the `flag`, then touch the `flag`
