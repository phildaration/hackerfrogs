# key points
* this level introduces us to the `tele` rule, which teleports objects between the same object each turn, (which requires there to be at least 2 of the same object in the level)
* not only the player is able to teleport, but other objects as well, and it can be used to move objects around the level, or out of the way of an objective
# method of solve
1) form the rule `love is push`
2) move the `love` into one of the water squares adjacent to the `flag`
3) form the rule `love is tele`
4) teleport around and then touch the `flag`
