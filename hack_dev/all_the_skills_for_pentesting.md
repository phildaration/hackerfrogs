# All the Skills for Pentesting (not really)
## Concept
* this document will discuss all of the skills that theShyHat learned for the purpose of getting a role in cybersecurity pentesting
* this is not a comprehensive list, but it meant to illustrate all of the concepts a person would need to learn to go from zero technical skill to pentester
