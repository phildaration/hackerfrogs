## Controversies / Notoriety
## Snowden's leaks revealed the following information

1. Mass Collection of Phone Metadata

    Program: PRISM and Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act
    Details: The NSA was collecting the phone records of millions of Americans, including call duration, time, and the numbers involved, from major telecommunications companies. This program did not record the content of calls but created a vast database of metadata that could be analyzed for patterns.

2. PRISM Program

    Details: PRISM was a secret program that allowed the NSA to directly access data from major U.S. tech companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. This data included emails, chat logs, videos, photos, and more, from both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals.

3. Global Internet Surveillance

    Programs: XKeyscore and TEMPORA
    Details: XKeyscore was a tool used by the NSA to search and analyze vast amounts of internet data collected from around the world, including emails, online chats, and browsing histories. TEMPORA, operated by the UK's GCHQ in collaboration with the NSA, tapped into fiber-optic cables to intercept internet traffic on a global scale.

4. Monitoring Foreign Leaders and Governments

    Details: The NSA was found to be spying on foreign leaders, including allies such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The agency intercepted phone calls, emails, and other communications from foreign governments, raising diplomatic tensions.

5. Boundless Informant

    Details: Snowden revealed a tool called Boundless Informant, which provided a visual overview of the NSA's data collection activities worldwide. It showed the volume of metadata collected in various countries, illustrating the global reach of the NSA’s surveillance.

6. Hacking and Exploiting Networks

    Programs: Tailored Access Operations (TAO)
    Details: The NSA’s TAO unit specialized in hacking into foreign computer networks, installing malware, and exploiting security vulnerabilities to gain access to communications and data. This included targeting routers, switches, and firewalls to create backdoors for ongoing surveillance.

7. Five Eyes Alliance

    Details: The disclosures shed light on the close cooperation between intelligence agencies in the Five Eyes alliance (U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand). These countries shared intelligence data, collaborated on surveillance operations, and extended the reach of each other’s spying capabilities.

8. Mass Surveillance on U.S. Allies

    Details: Beyond leaders, the NSA was involved in spying on foreign businesses, economic data, and ordinary citizens in allied countries, raising concerns about the extent of the agency’s reach and its potential impact on international relations.

9. NSA’s Attack on Encryption

    Details: The NSA worked to undermine encryption standards, making it easier to break the codes that protect online communications. This included efforts to weaken encryption algorithms and influence the development of international encryption standards to ensure the NSA could continue its surveillance activities.
