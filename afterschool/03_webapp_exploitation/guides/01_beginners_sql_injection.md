# Beginner's SQL Injection Guide
# UNION SELECT Injection
For most beginner SQL injection challenges, we are either dealing with SQL injection login bypass or in-band union select SQL injection. This guide will walk throught he process of working through in-band union select SQL injection attacks, where the goal is to obtain data from tables in the SQL database.
## 1 Identify Injection Point
The first step is to identify the injection point for SQL injection. For beginner challenges, the injection points are usually in a user submission field on a webpage or a URL parameter in the address bar. A common way to test if an injection point is valid is to send input in the form of a single quote ( ' ) or double quote ( " ). If the system returns an error message, that is a good indicator of a SQL injection point.
## 2 Determine Number of Columns for UNION SELECT
The second step is to determine how many columns the original SQL statement returned in a UNION SELECT statement. Observing the information returned by the web app can give us a good indicator of how many columns we should include. When testing for the number of columns, we should use null values to count the number of columns. For example:
```
' UNION SELECT null,null,null -- 
```
The above would test the system for 3 columns in the original statement.
## 3 Identify the DBMS used by the Web App
The third step is to determine the DBMS (the 'flavor' of SQL being used) by the web app. E.g., MySQL, MSSSQL, SQLite, etc. Some challenges will tell you the type of SQL system being used, but if there are no indications, we can use a few different functions to figure out what DBMS is being used.
